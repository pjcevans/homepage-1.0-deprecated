Used http://veithen.github.io/2015/03/26/jekyll-bootstrap.html for adding bootstrap Sass port to Jekyll
Sass variables are define in _sass/_variables.scss
The Sass bootstrap port repo is cloned to css/bootstrap-sass and is only used for updating bootstrap sass. To update bootstrap sass version cd into the repo, checkout the latest release branch and pull. Other than this functionality the bootstrap-sass repo could be removed.
