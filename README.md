### What

A simple blog recording self-study progression. [Link to the current build](https://pjcevans.github.io/)

### Why

Charting one's progress in any endeavour is useful in that it can help others to follow in your footsteps and can help you remember where you are going and where you have been. There are so many interesting things to learn that sometimes it's easy to end up going down a rabbit hole and not coming out for a few days. By keeping track of progress and writing about it objectively it can help to focus your efforts and situate what you are learning within the wider context.

### How

The site is built with Jekyll in order to break common code into reusable chunks and to provide basic blog functionality with the minimum of fuss on the back end. Style and structure is separate from content meaning that blog posts can be added by including a new markdown file, without the necessity or temptation to change the style or structure of the site.
