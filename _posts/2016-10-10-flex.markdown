Flex is a new approach to page or element layout, different to the block layout approach in that it does not use floats or collapsing margins. It is very much an approach with different screen sizes in mind and as such is a powerful tool for creating dynamic web pages without involving the complexities of a grid framework.

[Flexbox froggy](http://flexboxfroggy.com/) is a great little web app that runs through the positioning basics. Anyone who has worked with a block model based grid framework, or the block model directly, will get a feel for the implications for a new layout paradigm.

Flex represents to some the long overdue solution to the [Holy Grail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Grail_(web_design)) of web design problem, an "ideal" form of website that was very difficult or impossible to completely produce using the block model. [This article](https://philipwalton.github.io/solved-by-flexbox/demos/holy-grail/) by [Philip Walton](https://philipwalton.com/) gives a brief walkthrough of how to use Flex to achieve this form effective layouts that can scale well on different devices. It's definitely worth a try as the simplicity with which an adaptive layout can be constructed is pretty amazing.

The only downside is that supporting older browsers looks like it could be a challenge, particularly when it comes to something important as layout. Providing appropriate fallback when using a Flex layout is an area for further investigation.
