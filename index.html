  <h4 class="metadata">Peter J C Evans</h4>
  <p>This site began as a record of study progression - focussed initially on delving into GitHub Pages and Jekyll. It has since evolved to include a catalogue of small projects that I have worked on as well as a blog which reflects on the process of learning different technologies.</p>
  <p>This website uses <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> to logically separate elements of the websiteâ€™s code in order to make it easily manageable. The source is available in <a href="https://github.com/pjcevans/pjcevans.github.io">this GitHub repo.</a></p>
  <p>Aside from Jekyll and the integrated <a href="http://shopify.github.io/liquid/">Liquid</a> templating language no other third party code, in the form of libraries or frameworks, has been included. This is intentional as despite the easy facility that libraries, such as Bootstrap or jQuery, offer their use separates developers from the underlying code. I believe this can be restricting as it leads to thinking within a limited box, which an aspiring developer in a rapidly evolving field can rarely afford to do.</p>
