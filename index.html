  <h1>PJCE's Progress Blog</h1>
  <p class="metadata">Peter J C Evans</p>
  <p>This site began as a record of self-study progression and a delving into GitHub Pages and Jekyll, but has since evolved to become a place for cataloguing small projects that I have worked on as well as reflecting on the process of learning different technologies.</p>
  <p>This website is built with <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> the source code for the website is available in <a href="https://github.com/pjcevans/pjcevans.github.io">this GitHub repo.</a></p>
  <p>Aside from Jekyll and the integrated <a href="http://shopify.github.io/liquid/">Liquid</a> templating language no other third party code, in the form of libraries or frameworks, has been included. This is intentional as desipte the easy facility that libraries like Bootstrap or jQuery offer, their use seperates developers from the underlying code and can force people to think within a box, which an aspiring developer in a rapidly evolving field cannot afford to do.</p>
